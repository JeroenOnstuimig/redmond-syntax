# redmond-syntax theme

A syntax theme for Atom for those comfortable with the Visual Studio Blue theme.

The theme is fairly decent for working with TypeScript and CSS.  A few considerations for C#.  There is plenty left to do, and a few shortcomings in how Atom parses the languages prevent more accurate highlighting.
